# Dust Utility
Search through your collection for cards that aren't being used in any deck in order to see which can be disenchanted.

### Settings
* Offline Mode: Open Hearthstone, head to "Play" and stay there for a couple of seconds, so the plugin can store your collection and decks locally.
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page

## ToDo
* History of disenchanted cards (only works with Offline Mode enabled)

# Hearthstone Pack History
Also take a look at my [Hearthstone Pack History](https://github.com/CLJunge/Spawn.HearthstonePackHistory) app.

A neat app that automatically keeps track of your pack openings and offers statistics based on them.
* Supports multiple accounts and regions!
