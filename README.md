# Dust Utility
Search through your collection for cards that aren't being used in any deck in order to see which can be disenchanted.

### Settings
* Offline Mode: Open Hearthstone, head to "Play" and stay there for a couple of seconds, so the plugin can store your collection and decks locally.
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page

## ToDo
* Add setting to allow searching through all cards and not only unused ones
