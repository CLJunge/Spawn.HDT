# Dust Utility v2.0
Enter the amout of dust you are aiming for and the plugin searches through your whole collection or cards that aren't being used in any deck in order for you to see which you can disenchant.

## Features
#### Offline Mode
- The plugin detects the current account and saves it collection and decks locally, so you are still able to use the plugin while Hearthstone isn't running. (Decks are only being saved when you are in the "Play" menu)

## Settings
* Offline Mode: After opening the main window the plugin is going to try to store collection and decks locally every 10 sec while Hearthstone is running (Decks can only be saved after visiting the "Play" menu once). If successful, it will try to store collection and decks and check for disenchanted cards every minute while Hearthstone is running.
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page after opening the main window.
