## Dust Utility
Search through your collection for cards that aren't being used in any deck in order to see which can be disenchanted.

### Settings
* Offline Mode: Open Hearthstone, head to "Play" and stay there for a couple of seconds, so the plugin can store your collection and decks locally.

## ToDo
* Update notification system
* Add setting the allows to search through all cards and not only unused ones
* Improve search (Searching for e.g. 5 Dust shows 2 copies of a card if available instead of just a single copy)
* Improve README.md (Documentation)
* Clean up/Commentate source code
