### Settings
* Offline Mode: Open Hearthstone, head to "Play" and stay there for a couple of seconds, so the plugin can store your collection and decks locally.
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page

## ToDo
* Nothing to do for now...

## Hearthstone Pack History
Also take a look at the [Hearthstone Pack History](https://github.com/CLJunge/Spawn.HearthstonePackHistoryHearthstone).
