# Dust Utility
Enter the amout of dust you are aiming for and the plugin searches through your collection for cards that aren't being used in any deck in order for you to see which can be disenchanted.

### Features
* Offline Mode - The plugin saves your collection and decks locally, so you are still able to use it while Hearthstone isn't running.
* Customizable Sort Order - Order the result for your needs. Sortable properties: Mana Cost, Name, Dust, Class, Set, etc...
* Since version 1.6, you are also able to search through all your cards, instead of just the unused ones.

### Settings
* Offline Mode: Open Hearthstone, head to "Play" and stay there for a couple of seconds, so the plugin can store your collection and decks locally.
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page

## ToDo
* History of disenchanted cards (only works with Offline Mode enabled)
* Enter card name, card id, card ability (Lifesteal, Taunt, etc.) to search for specific cards


# Hearthstone Pack History
Also take a look at my [Hearthstone Pack History](https://github.com/CLJunge/Spawn.HearthstonePackHistory) app.

A neat app that automatically keeps track of your pack openings and offers statistics based on them.
* Supports multiple accounts and regions!
