## Features
#### Offline Mode
- The plugin detects the current account and saves it collection and decks locally, so you are still able to use the plugin while Hearthstone isn't running.

#### Card History
- Whenever the plugin stores collection and decks it compares the locally saved collection with your current one and detects which cards are new and which have been disenchanted. (newest to oldest)
