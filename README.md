# Dust Utility
Enter the amout of dust you are aiming for and the plugin searches through your collection for cards that aren't being used in any deck in order for you to see which can be disenchanted.

### Features
* Offline Mode - The plugin saves your collection and decks locally, so you are still able to use it while Hearthstone isn't running.
* Customizable Sort Order - Order the result for your needs. Sortable properties: Mana Cost, Name, Dust, Class, Set, etc...
* Since version 1.6, you are also able to search through all your cards, instead of just the unused ones.
* An advanced search was added with version 1.7, which allows you to search for specific cards
