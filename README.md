# Dust Utility v2.0
Enter the amout of dust you are aiming for and the plugin searches through your whole collection or cards that aren't being used in any deck in order for you to see which can be disenchanted.

## Features
#### Offline Mode
- The plugin detects the current account and saves it collection and decks locally, so you are still able to use the plugin while Hearthstone isn't running.

#### Card History
- Whenever the plugin stores collection and decks it compares the locally saved collection with your current one and detects which cards are new and which have been disenchanted.

## Settings
* Offline Mode: While the plugin is enabled, it checks if HS is running and stores collection and decks (Decks can only be saved when you are in the "Play" menu) locally. (every 2 min.)
* Check For Updates: Checks if there is new release available on the GitHub page after opening the main window.
